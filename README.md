Purpose:
This was just a test since I started learning how to use Selenium.
Basically, I had Selenium go to Google search page and searched for the stock that I want to obtain the current price.  Then, I figured out the difference of the bought price to the current and show the difference in red if it's negative and green if it's positive.

What you need to get this running:
1) Python 3.10 or above
2) Download the files into a directory c:\Selenium
3) Use the requirement.txt to obtain the required libraries
4) Download the Edge webdriver: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/?form=MA13LH and copy it to the root directory of this project in a folder called EdgeDriver
5) Run the test.py
